Create high-converting sales funnels on WordPress that look professional by following a well-guided step-by-step process.

== Description ==

WooFunnels allows you to create high-converting sales funnels on WordPress that look professional by following a well-guided step-by-step process.

You can create different types of funnels such as free plus shipping funnel, self-liquidating offer funnel, and more to generate greater profits in your business.

== Why do you need a sales funnel? ==

A sales funnel is designed to drive more traffic to your business. It doesn’t overwhelm your user with multiple choices on the page - they either buy the product, or exit the page.

So you take them from a dedicated built-for-conversions sales page to the checkout page and then show them relevant upsell offers.

Here are some major benefits of a sales funnel:

- **Less Distractions:** A website can be very distracting with all the options and information presented to the viewer. From Products list, to ‘About Us’, everything is present under the same page stealing at least some of the viewer’s attention.
On the other hand, a sales page is very streamlined and the user is not confused with too many options on the page., as can be noted in a study done by Yuppiechef. They saw that removing the navigation bar on their landing page led to 100% conversion. Isn’t that just brilliant?

- **High Returns on Ad Spends:** Directing traffic over to a dedicated sales funnel can get you a greater return on your ad spends than directing them to the website homepage.

- **Greater Order Value:** You can show your customers relevant post-purchase offers that they can accept with one click, hence increasing their order value.

- **More Conversions:** With sequences in place to reach out to your abandoned users and coaxing them into completing the payment, the overall conversion rate definitely goes up.

> WooFunnels is built for digital and physical product sellers who want to go beyond conventional websites to convert more visitors into customers.

Let's explore the major features of WooFunnels.

== WooFunnels LITE FEATURES: ==

**1. Sales Page Templates:** To make the whole sales page designing process easier for you, we have provided you with pre-built highly-converting sales page templates. These are beautifully designed to showcase your products, highlight its benefits, social proof and more.

**2. Checkout Pages:** Design checkout pages exactly how you want them to be - with options to add products, display the trust seal, testimonials to reassure the customers of their purchase, arrange form fields - among many other options.

**3. Contacts:** Keep a track of all your customers in one place. Know  who made a purchase, and what their order total was, just at a glance with Contacts.

== WooFunnels PRO FEATURE: ==

With the Pro version you get access to all of the features from the Lite version, and so much more. Some of the extra features that you get with Pro are:

**1. Discounting:** With Pro you would be able to apply discounts to your products displayed on the checkout page, and we all sure love discounts!

**2. Offering Product Choice:** Give your customers the option to choose the exact product they wish to buy from multiple options, right on the checkout page. It can be in the form of a checkbox, or radio buttons, however you wish to display them.

**3. Create Multi-Step Forms:** Wish to switch up your single page, one-step checkout form with a multi-step one? It is possible with the Pro. You also get the option to build a two-step or three-step form with the same ease as the one-sep format.

**4. Add New Fields:** You can add new fields to your checkout form in various types, namely - HTML,radio, checkbox, dropdown, email, number etc. This helps you get the information you want from your customers.

**5. Optimize your checkout:** With Pro you can optimize your checkout page by adding Google Address Autofill, Auto Apply Coupon, Smart buttons for Express Checkout,and more. These optimizations make the user experience better and help reduce abandonment.

**6. One-Click Upsell:** The major work of a funnel is done on the backend, because this is where you get to generate most of your profit. One-Click Upsell is a smart way for you to increase the total revenue generated on one sale.

**7. Order Bump:** Similarly, another option to increase the average order value of any purchase is to offer them Order Bumps. These are offers embedded on the checkout page that can be added to the order with just one-click.

**8. Analytics:** With Pro, you can not only study your customer purchases individually, but compare them to one another. Real-time changes can also be observed here as the sales are taking place with views that each page got and their respective conversion rates. Insights like these would help you make the necessary changes and increase the sales.

== Why us? ==

As an agency back in the day, serving one-on-one clients and building solutions on top of WordPress and WooCommerce, we realized that there weren’t many smart solutions available to build sales funnels in WordPress, and so we decided to build one. A solution with seamless user experience, and one that did not bind the user into paying hundreds of dollars every month.

All of this led us to create *- WooFunnels -* an interface that is designed keeping the users in mind.

And now you can enjoy a very intuitive and guided user experience to create your sales funnel within minutes, without having to hire a developer or a designer in the process.
