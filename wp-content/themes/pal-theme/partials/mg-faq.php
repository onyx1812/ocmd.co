    <div class="question">How does Rejuvenation reduce wrinkles, lift the skin and brighten complexion?</div>
    <div class="answer">It uses a combination of 3 different sizes of Hyaluronic Acid molecules and 17 carefully selected active ingredients, including apple stem cell extracts, vitamin liposomes, and natural compounds like lactic acid. Our unique formula gently exfoliates the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and penetrates into the lower skin levels to optimize product efficiency. The Shrunken Hyaluronic Acid molecules trap moisture. The Swiss Apple Stem Cells increase skin stem cell regeneration by up to 80% and reduce the damage of UV sun light on skin stem cells by as much as 46%. The vitamin liposomes nourish the skin. Other active ingredients trigger and enhance Elastin & Collagen production. The result of all this is a tighter, smoother skin and a brighter complexion.</div>
