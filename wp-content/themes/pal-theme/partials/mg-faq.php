		<div class="question">How does Hydrolift reduce wrinkles, lifts the skin and brightens complexion?</div>
		<div class="answer">Hydrolift uses a combination of 3 sizes of Hyaluronic Acid molecules and a hand picked selection of 17 active ingredients, including apple stem cells extracts, vitamin liposomes, and natural compounds like lactic acid. Our formula gently exfoliates the epidermis and penetrates into the lower skin levels to optimize product efficiency. The Shrunken Hyaluronic Acid molecules trap moisture. The Swiss Apple Stem Cells Increase skin stem cell regeneration by 80% and reduce the damage of UV sun light on skin stem cells by 46%. The vitamin liposomes nourish the skin. Other active ingredients trigger and enhance Elastin & Collagen production. The result of all this is a tighter, smoother skin and a brighter complexion.</div>
