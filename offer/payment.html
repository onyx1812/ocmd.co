  <p align="JUSTIFY">We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics (including Google Signals, Google User-ID, and other Google Analytics features) and MixPanel) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices to better tailor services and features; and provide certain features to you.&nbsp; If you have a Google account with personalized advertising enabled, through Google Signals, Google will also be able to gather for us analytics and engagement information from across the various devices you use to access the Services. To prevent Google from using your information for analytics (including cross-device tracking for personalization purposes), you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>. And to opt out of Google Signals, please open your “Settings” app, locate and tap “Google,” select “Ads,” and turn ON “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”&nbsp; You may also be able to disable cross-device tracking through your Android or Apple device-based settings.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

  <p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Online Advertising</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Facebook, Google Ad Words, Criteo and others) that use cookies and other technologies to deliver relevant content and advertising for products on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third party advertising network services. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">link</a>, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">link</a>, or the Your Online Choices <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">link </a>to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. If you are interested in more information about Criteo’s privacy practices or opting-out of Criteo’s advertising services, you may view their Privacy Policy. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
  <ol start="3">
  <li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Mobile Advertising</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">When using mobile applications from us or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>

  <p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Notice Concerning Do Not Track</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="HOWWESHAREYOURINFORMATION"></a> <strong>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION </strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">OCMD may share your information in the following ways:</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Affiliates &amp; Related Business Entities. </em>We may share the information we collect with our affiliates or related business entities for the purposes of delivering products or services to you, ensuring a consistent level of service, and to enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Service Providers and Third-Party Vendors.</em> We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who use the information to perform services on our behalf. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, shipping and fulfillment, data storage, IT and security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and auditing and legal services. These entities may also include health care organizations and other third parties we use to support our business or in connection with the administration and support of the Services.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Legal Compliance.</em> By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain, and disclose information we collect and maintain about you if reasonably necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, or OCMD’s legal rights.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Business Transfers. </em> As OCMD continues to grow, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions, your information may be among the assets that are transferred.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Public Forums.</em> Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users. Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and we may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other marketing materials). For example, if you submit a product review on one of our Websites or blogs, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on other OCMD websites and on third-party websites. Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Accordingly, please take care when using these features.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Aggregate/De-Identified Information.</em> We reserve the right to create Aggregate/De-Identified Data from the information we collect through the services and our sharing of such Aggregate/De-Identified Data is in our sole discretion.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="THIRDPARTYLINKSANDCONTENT"></a> <strong>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND CONTENT</strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The Website and email messages that you receive from OCMD may sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third parties. OCMD is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. OCMD does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services available on such third party websites. The inclusion of a link to a website does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="HOWDOWEPROTECTCOLLECTEDPERSONALINF"></a><a name="DATASECURITY"></a> <strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We will implement reasonable and appropriate security procedures consistent with prevailing industry standards to protect data from unauthorized access by physical and electronic intrusion. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information by following generally accepted industry standards, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or archive at this Site.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="SUBMITTINGINFOFROMOUTSIDETHEUS"></a><a name="changes"></a> <strong>SUBMITTING INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We control and operate the online and mobile resources from within the United States of America (the “U.S.”). Information collected through the Website and Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our vendors maintain facilities. Although we do not actively block or monitor visitors from other countries, the Website is directed only at visitors from the U.S. As such, this Privacy Policy is consistent with U.S. law and practice and is not adapted to other laws (including European data security and privacy laws). OCMD will apply the applicable laws of the U.S. including as embodied in this Privacy Policy in place of data protections under your home country's law. That is, you freely and unambiguously acknowledge that this Privacy Policy, not your home country's laws, controls how we will collect, store, process, and transfer your personal information. Similarly, the English language version of this Privacy Policy is the controlling version regardless of any translation you may attempt.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="DataPrivacyAndProtectionLaws"></a><a name="DATAPRIVACYANDPROTECTIONLAWSCCPAGDPR"></a> <strong>DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION LAWS: THE CCPA AND GDPR</strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Privacy and data protection laws vary around the world and among the several United States. Some of those laws are more specific than others.&nbsp;Most prominently, residents of California and data subjects whose personal information was obtained from them while they were in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland have certain additional rights in cases where the party collecting that information is governed by the applicable law. We have reviewed our business operations and data-related business practices with legal counsel in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation under European Law also known as the “GDPR” and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). As a result of that review, as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we do not believe we are governed by either the GDPR or CCPA.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We do not, for instance, collect personal information from data subjects in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland or elsewhere abroad. Similarly, we do not target or tailor our Website or Services or any of our other US-based business activities to appeal to, or specifically attempt to do business in those jurisdictions. In terms of California, although we may do business within the state, we do not meet any of the various statutory thresholds and criteria that would bring us under the CCPA.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">For general visitors, consumers and regulators who have questions about whether or how the GDPR, CCPA or other industry- or jurisdiction-specific laws apply to us, you can contact us using the contact information below.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="CHILDRENSPRIVACY"></a> <strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Federal law imposes special restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct their operations toward, and collect and use information from children under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements very seriously, and, consistent with them, do not intend for our Website or Services to be used by children under the age of 18, and certainly not by anyone under the age of 13. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 18. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information to us via our Website or Services, we will delete that information and not use it for any purpose whatsoever. We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children about the potential risks of providing personal information over the Internet.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="CHANGESTOTHISPRIVACYSTATEMENT"></a> <strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check our Website periodically for such changes since all information collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection. Typically, we will indicate the effective/amendment date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If we feel it is appropriate, or if the law requires, we’ll also provide a summary of changes we’ve made near the end of the new Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>General</strong></span></p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Arbitration is a manner of resolving a “Claim” without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, OCMD, or any involved third party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with OCMD, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by OCMD or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, OCMD, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. OCMD agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against OCMD By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</span></p>

  <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Exceptions</strong></span></p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and OCMD both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court’s jurisdiction. OCMD will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Florida: (i) an action by OCMD relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by OCMD for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection “b” in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection “b,” the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Florida, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ jurisdiction and venue.</span></p>

OCMD will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with OCMD or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in Florida to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection “b” above.

  <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under subsection “b” above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection “d” above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’S Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or OCMD.</span></p>

To prevent Google from using your information for analytics (including cross-device tracking for personalization purposes), you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>. And to opt out of Google Signals, please open your “Settings” app, locate and tap “Google,” select “Ads,” and turn ON “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”&nbsp; You may also be able to disable cross-device tracking through your Android or Apple device-based settings.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.

      </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Facebook, Google Ad Words, Criteo and others) that use cookies and other technologies to deliver relevant content and advertising for products on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third party advertising network services. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">link</a>, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">link</a>, or the Your Online Choices <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">link </a>to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.

To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>

We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="HOWWESHAREYOURINFORMATION"></a> <strong>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION </strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">OCMD may share your information in the following ways:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Affiliates &amp; Related Business Entities. </em>We may share the information we collect with our affiliates or related business entities for the purposes of delivering products or services to you, ensuring a consistent level of service, and to enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Service Providers and Third-Party Vendors.</em> We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who use the information to perform services on our behalf. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, shipping and fulfillment, data storage, IT and security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and auditing and legal services. These entities may also include health care organizations and other third parties we use to support our business or in connection with the administration and support of the Services.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Legal Compliance.</em> By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain, and disclose information we collect and maintain about you if reasonably necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, or OCMD’s legal rights.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Business Transfers. </em> As OCMD continues to grow, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions, your information may be among the assets that are transferred.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Public Forums.</em> Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users. Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and we may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other marketing materials). For example, if you submit a product review on one of our Websites or blogs, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on other OCMD websites and on third-party websites. Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Accordingly, please take care when using these features.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Aggregate/De-Identified Information.</em> We reserve the right to create Aggregate/De-Identified Data from the information we collect through the services and our sharing of such Aggregate/De-Identified Data is in our sole discretion.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="THIRDPARTYLINKSANDCONTENT"></a> <strong>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND CONTENT</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The Website and email messages that you receive from OCMD may sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third parties. OCMD is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. OCMD does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services available on such third party websites.

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="HOWDOWEPROTECTCOLLECTEDPERSONALINF"></a><a name="DATASECURITY"></a> <strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We will implement reasonable and appropriate security procedures consistent with prevailing industry standards to protect data from unauthorized access by physical and electronic intrusion. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information by following generally accepted industry standards, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or archive at this Site.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="SUBMITTINGINFOFROMOUTSIDETHEUS"></a><a name="changes"></a> <strong>SUBMITTING INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We control and operate the online and mobile resources from within the United States of America (the “U.S.”). Information collected through the Website and Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our vendors maintain facilities. Although we do not actively block or monitor visitors from other countries, the Website is directed only at visitors from the U.S. As such, this Privacy Policy is consistent with U.S. law and practice and is not adapted to other laws (including European data security and privacy laws). OCMD will apply the applicable laws of the U.S. including as embodied in this Privacy Policy in place of data protections under your home country's law. That is, you freely and unambiguously acknowledge that this Privacy Policy, not your home country's laws, controls how we will collect, store, process, and transfer your personal information. Similarly, the English language version of this Privacy Policy is the controlling version regardless of any translation you may attempt.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="DataPrivacyAndProtectionLaws"></a><a name="DATAPRIVACYANDPROTECTIONLAWSCCPAGDPR"></a> <strong>DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION LAWS: THE CCPA AND GDPR</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Privacy and data protection laws vary around the world and among the several United States. Some of those laws are more specific than others.&nbsp;Most prominently, residents of California and data subjects whose personal information was obtained from them while they were in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland have certain additional rights in cases where the party collecting that information is governed by the applicable law. We have reviewed our business operations and data-related business practices with legal counsel in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation under European Law also known as the “GDPR” and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). As a result of that review, as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we do not believe we are governed by either the GDPR or CCPA.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We do not, for instance, collect personal information from data subjects in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland or elsewhere abroad. Similarly, we do not target or tailor our Website or Services or any of our other US-based business activities to appeal to, or specifically attempt to do business in those jurisdictions. In terms of California, although we may do business within the state, we do not meet any of the various statutory thresholds and criteria that would bring us under the CCPA.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">For general visitors, consumers and regulators who have questions about whether or how the GDPR, CCPA or other industry- or jurisdiction-specific laws apply to us, you can contact us using the contact information below.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="CHILDRENSPRIVACY"></a> <strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Federal law imposes special restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct their operations toward, and collect and use information from children under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements very seriously, and, consistent with them, do not intend for our Website or Services to be used by children under the age of 18, and certainly not by anyone under the age of 13. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 18. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information to us via our Website or Services, we will delete that information and not use it for any purpose whatsoever. We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children about the potential risks of providing personal information over the Internet.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="CHANGESTOTHISPRIVACYSTATEMENT"></a> <strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check our Website periodically for such changes since all information collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection. Typically, we will indicate the effective/amendment date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If we feel it is appropriate, or if the law requires, we’ll also provide a summary of changes we’ve made near the end of the new Privacy Policy.</p>

      </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Arbitration is a manner of resolving a “Claim” without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, OCMD, or any involved third party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with OCMD, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by OCMD or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, OCMD, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. OCMD agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against OCMD By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: medium;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and OCMD both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court’s jurisdiction. OCMD will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Florida: (i) an action by OCMD relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by OCMD for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection “b” in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection “b,” the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Florida, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ jurisdiction and venue.</span></p>

If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in Florida to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection “b” above.

The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’S Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision.
